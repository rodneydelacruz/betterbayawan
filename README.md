2. **Output location**
   - Minified files are generated in the `dist/` folder
   - Original size: ~17MB → Minified: ~3.9MB

3. **Deploy to server**
   - Upload contents of `dist/` to your web server's `public_html` directory
   - Ensure `.htaccess` is included for clean URLs, CSP headers, and security

### File Permissions (cPanel)

| Type        | Permission | Numeric |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Files       | rw-r--r--  | 644     |
| Directories | rwxr-xr-x  | 755     |

## Multi-language Support (i18n)

The site supports three languages with full translation coverage:

| Language | Code  | Status                |
| -------- | ----- | --------------------- |
| English  | `en`  | Complete (5,546 keys) |
| Filipino | `fil` | Complete (5,546 keys) |
| Ilocano  | `ilo` | Complete (5,546 keys) |

The static site uses a `TranslationEngine` in `assets/js/translations.js` with `data-i18n` attributes on HTML elements. The React version uses a `LanguageContext` provider with a `t()` function. Both systems support fallback to English for any missing keys.

## Three-Version Architecture

The project maintains three synchronized versions:

| Version                | Location        | Purpose                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Static Legacy**      | Root HTML files | Source of truth for all 52 pages     |
| **React + TypeScript** | `react-app/`    | Modern component-based homepage      |
| **Production Dist**    | `dist/`         | Minified build for cPanel deployment |

All CSS, images, animations, and translations are kept in sync across all three versions. The build script (`build.sh`) generates the dist from the static legacy source.

- Synced footer CSS fix to React version

#### CI/CD Cleanup

- Removed CodeQL Advanced workflow (`.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) as it is no longer required

#### Responsive Header & Hotline Marquee

- Standardized header vertical spacing (padding, min-height, logo size) across desktop (12px/48px), tablet (10px/40px), mobile (8px/36px), and small mobile (6px/32px) breakpoints
- Raised tablet breakpoint from 991px to 1024px to properly capture iPad Pro portrait (1024px) and iPad Air landscape
- Converted emergency hotline bar into a clickable scrolling marquee on all tablet and mobile viewports (≤1024px) with pause-on-hover/focus for accessibility
- Centered hamburger menu icon between logo and language toggle on tablet viewports using flexbox ordering (logo → hamburger → lang toggle)
- Tablet footer: left-aligned BetterSolano logo, tagline, and social icons to match the visual hierarchy of the brand column

#### Progressive Web App (PWA)

- Rewrote `sw.js` with dual-cache architecture: `STATIC_CACHE` (precached app shell) and `RUNTIME_CACHE` (dynamic content, 80-item FIFO, 7-day TTL)
- Navigation uses network-first with offline fallback; static assets use stale-while-revalidate; data/API uses network-first with cache fallback
- Added push notification and background sync foundations
- Enhanced SW registration with 30-minute update polling and non-intrusive refresh banner on new version activation
- Upgraded `manifest.webmanifest` with maskable icons, app shortcuts (Services, Contact, Government, Transparency), and `orientation: any`
- Added iOS PWA meta tags (`apple-mobile-web-app-capable`, `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style`, `apple-mobile-web-app-title`)
- Fixed theme-color from old green (#1a5f2a) to brand blue (#0032a0) across all files
- Updated offline fallback page colors to match brand

#### Automatic Version Management

- Created cross-platform `scripts/bump-version.js` (Node.js) replacing the bash-only `version.sh` for Windows compatibility
- Version bump updates `version.json`, `package.json`, all 51+ HTML files, and syncs to `react-app/public/version.json`
- Git pre-commit hook auto-bumps patch version on every commit (skips version-only commits to prevent loops)
- Footer version displayed dynamically at runtime via `version.js` fetching from `version.json`

#### React App Sync

- Created `HotlineBar.tsx` component with tablet/mobile marquee matching static site behavior
- Created `InfoBar.tsx` component with live exchange rates, weather, and Philippine time
- Created `SearchAutocomplete.tsx` component with service search dropdown
- Created `PWAManager.tsx` component handling install prompt and seamless SW updates
- Updated `Footer.tsx` to dynamically fetch version from `/version.json` instead of hardcoded value
- Updated `Header.tsx` breakpoint from 991px to 1024px, fixed ARIA attribute string values
- Updated `layout.tsx` with corrected theme-color, manifest link, Apple PWA meta tags, and PWAManager integration
- Synced `manifest.webmanifest`, `version.json`, `sw.js`, and all CSS to react-app

#### Code Quality & Tooling

- Installed Prettier as dev dependency with project-wide configuration (`.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`)
- Formatted entire codebase (120+ files) for consistent code style
- Git pre-commit hook auto-formats staged files with Prettier before each commit
- Fixed `privacy/index.html` malformed HTML (duplicate `</body></html>` closing tags)
- Resolved all npm vulnerabilities: upgraded `@lhci/cli` to ^0.15.1, added `tmp` override to 0.2.5 (0 vulnerabilities)
- Added `npm run format` and `npm run format:check` scripts

- Apache `.htaccess` rewrite rules handle clean URL resolution on cPanel

### Build & Deployment

- Updated `build.sh` rsync excludes to filter out dev artifacts (`.backup`, `.md`, `package*.json`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, etc.)
- Production dist: 52 HTML pages, 106 total files, 3.9MB, zero dev artifacts
- Updated CSP headers: added `worker-src 'self' blob:`, `blob:` to `connect-src`, CDN domains to `connect-src` for dotlottie-player and Bootstrap Icons compatibility

### Cross-Version Sync
